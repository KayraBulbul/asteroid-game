# Asteroid Game Project

This is a basic asteroid game built using pygame.
This was a boot.dev course to practice object-oriented programming.

## Gameplay

- Move the player using WASD and SPACE to shoot
- Shot asteroids will be split or destroyed depending on their size
- Large and medium sized asteroids will split into 2 pieces and move faster
- If the player collides with an asteroid, the game exits

## Planned additions

- Asteroid/asteroid collisions (currently only player/asteroid collisions)
- Respawn and life system
- Score with persistent highscore system

These are just the main plans, I do have more ideas but will wait on implementing those until these are done.

## How to play

Just run main.py in the terminal using:

```
python main.py
```

Or can alternatively use uv if you have it installed:

```
uv run main.py
```
